package centos kernel sources into kernel-sources  package and install it, with the -fno-pie patch (for nvidia-drivers (opencl)).

cmake.eclass: consider adding (see sci-libs/parmetis for example)
-DCMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH=ON
-DCMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH=OFF
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH=OFF

|| die for each non-standard invocation

pmi (libpmi2-slurm) -- slots for v1 and v2 (parallel installation)

sys-libs/libcap: with pam enabled (but no pam installed?) -- fails to compile due to security/pam.h missing

cmake.eclass: prepare followed by configure is broekn
python distutils-r1.eclass same problem with "single" type

petsc: incremental compile->merge  borken because merge removes build-dir-debug/bin -- WTF?

check overriding of cflags everywhere

document flags everywhere

add die everywhere

has_version exists, does has_use exist?

mumps/scotch: Libs.private: is linking trouble due to the private dep somehow
not included in ELF .so?

move vtk to sci-visualization?

add github ids to metadata.xml

idea: when depending on virtual/* package, trigger rebuild of dependees if the
concrete package that  satisfies the virtual changes.
