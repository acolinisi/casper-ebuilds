    The CADNA (Control of Accuracy and Debugging for Numerical Applications)
    software estimates round-off errors in numerical simulations.

    CADNA uses the CESTAC method to estimate in any computed result which
    digits are affected by round-off errors. Moreover CADNA implements all
    the concepts and definitions of the stochastic arithmetic, specially the
    definitions of order relations and equality relation. To be very short,
    these definitions take into account the accuracy of the operands.
    Therefore CADNA enables a real numerical debugging by detecting numerical
    instabilities which usually involve numerical noise. The last (but not
    the least) tool provided by CADNA is that data errors can be taken into
    account for the estimation of the final accuracy.

    CADNA contains all the controls that are necessary for a good and
    efficient implementation of the CESTAC method. These controls, that were
    pointed out by the theoretical study, lead to a self-validation of the
    library. CADNA is able to detect when the conditions for a right
    estimation of the round-off errors are not satisfied anymore and when it
    happens, CADNA is able to advise the users.
